Curerently I'm making my way into building a game from scratch using my own containers, algorithms, memory allocators, File I/O handling, multithreading etc and that comes in the shape of a core library called HSTL.

HSTL is supposed to be an easy-to-read high perofmance stl-like library, it currently has..
- Dynamic Array.
- Hash Set.
- Hash Map.
- Logging.
- Error handling that is not exceptions.

and It will keep growing inshallah until I can use it to build a game from scratch.
